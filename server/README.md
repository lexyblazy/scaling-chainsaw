## Install dependencies

In the server directory, open the command line and install all dependecies
```sh
yarn install
```

## Requirements

The server needs:
-  a minimum of node v12.0.0 as specified in the `.nvmrc` file
-  Postgresql (You need to first create the database via postgres CLI before the server can connect to it,  Checkout [this tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-a-restful-api-with-node-js-and-postgresql-d96d6fc892d8/))

## Adding Environment variables
create a `.env` file add the following config variables

```env
SQL_HOST=<YOUR_SQL_HOST_HERE>
SQL_USER=<YOUR_SQL_USER_HERE>
SQL_PASSWORD=<YOUR_SQL_PASSWORD_HERE>
SQL_DATABASE=<YOUR_SQL_DATABSE_HERE>
PORT=<YOUR_PORT_HERE>

```

In the `ormconfig.json` and `ormconfig.ts` files, I have used `the_room_services` as the database,
You're free to use any database name of your choice as long as you've created previously. Also remember to keep it consistent across the following files
- `ormconfig.json`
- `ormconfig.ts`
- `.env` â€” `process.env.SQL_DATABASE` to be precise

## Run database migrations

I have put a script in the `package.json` that executes the database migrations

```
yarn run:db:migrations
```

## Seeding the database

 The spec did not indicate how services or promocodes would be created, so the database needs to be seeded.
 
 NOTES
  -  All Service names are UPPERCASE and  STRING types
  -  All promo codes are UPPERCASE and  STRING types
  -  Discount values are generated randomly with Math.random()

  See the `src/seed.ts` file to add more services and promo codes. To seed the database run the below command
  
```sh
yarn seed:db
```

To run the server
```sh
yarn start 
```
